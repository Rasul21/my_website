<h1>Challenge 1: Replicating a chart</h1>
<p>I have created a publication-ready plot using our <code>dplyr</code> and <code>ggplot2</code> skills.</p>
<p>The bubble chart that we replicated shows the position of the states in terms of the firearms related cases of homicide and suicide across white males. The bubble size is determined by a white population of the state and the color of the dot is responsible for the gun ownership category. The states with high gun ownership rates are the ones with highest suicide and homicide rates. What can also be inferred from the graph is that the states with highest suicide rates and gun ownership are those with low white population figures. Hence, on average, white male has a lower chance to be involved in homicide or a suicide if he lives in a state with large white population figures.
As to the replication of this graph, it first required some work over the dataset, as only firearms related cases should be depicted and there were some NAâ€™s all over the dataset. Correct labeling of the bubbles in the chart, painting them in accordance with Gun ownership category, and setting the size proportional to white population was followed by scaling the bubble size and correctly representing the legend. Two libraries were activated to avoid text overlapping and to set matching color scheme. Custom theme allows to control for font size, grid lines and other. Figure size was controlled for and the graph was set to be square to match the original version.
Below you can see our version of the article plot:</p>
