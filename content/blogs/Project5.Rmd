# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Running the code below allows to access the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  vroom::vroom("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", #read data
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

1. First we selected the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset.

```{r tidyweather_select}
tidyweather <- weather %>%
  select("Year","Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep","Oct", "Nov", "Dec") 
#selecting the columns we need
kable(head(tidyweather,5)) #visalise 

```

2. We next converted the dataframe from wide to 'long' format using `pivot_longer()` function. Name of the new dataframe is `tidyweather`.The variable containing the name of the month is `month`, and the temperature deviation is `delta`.


```{r tidyweather}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=2:13, 
               names_to="Month", 
               values_to = "delta") #transforming to longer format
kable(head(tidyweather, 5)) #visualise
tidyweather
```

The new cleaned dataset has three variables now, one each for

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

We, as a next step, proceed to plotting the data using a time-series scatter plot with a trendline. To do that, we first created a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 

```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")), #creating dates
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+ #building a plot
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies are skyrocketing " #adding title
  )+
  ylab("temperture deviation")+
  xlab("Year")

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+ #building a plot
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  facet_wrap(~month)+ #showing months separately 
  theme_bw() + #using theme black and white
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies are skyrocketing" #add titles
  )+
  ylab("temperture deviation")+ #x-axis title
  xlab("Year") #y-axis title

```


**It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. We created a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. **

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>%
  select(Year, month, delta) %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

We might be interested in average annual anomalies, so let's proceed to them instead of monthly data. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

We construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}
formula_ci <- comparison %>% 

  # choose the interval 2011-present
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
  # calculate necessary statistics for delta
  summarise(
            mean = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE), # calculate mean
            count = n(), # count
            sd_delta = sd(delta, na.rm=TRUE), #SE
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), #critical value of t-statistics
            lower_ci_95 = mean - (t_critical*sd_delta/sqrt(count)), #lower bound CI
            upper_ci_95 = mean + (t_critical*sd_delta/sqrt(count))) #upper bound CI
  
formula_ci

```



```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

point_estimate <- comparison %>% 
  filter(interval=="2011-present") %>% 
  specify(response = delta) %>% #specifying the variable
  calculate(stat="mean") %>% #specifying the statistics
  dplyr:: pull() 

bootstrap_ci <- comparison %>% 
  filter(interval=="2011-present") %>% #choosing the interval
  specify(response = delta) %>% #specifying the variable
  hypothesize(null="point", mu=0.2) %>% 
  generate(reps=1000, type="bootstrap") %>% #generating bootstrap
  calculate(stat="mean") %>% #calculating the mean
 get_confidence_interval(
    point_estimate = point_estimate,
    level = 0.95, #choosing Cl
   type="se" 
 )
bootstrap_ci

```

What we have done is calculated the 95% confidence interval for the population mean for temperature variations.
We used two different methods and we came to conclusion that we are 95% confident that the true mean of temperature variations (delta) lies within the interval from 0.915 to 1.02. As the graph have shown, delta is increasing throughout the time, meaning that the population mean is the highest from the whole period for which we have observations
